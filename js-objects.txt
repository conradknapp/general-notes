How do you use Object.assign()?

Object.assign() returns a new object but keeps all of the properties of the object that it accept.

var me = {
  first: "Conrad",
  last: "Knapp"
};

var newMe = Object.assign({}, me);

newMe; // {first: "Conrad", last: "Knapp"}

me === newMe; // false 

/* me and notMe are not the same object */

You can also specify more properties (with as many additional arguments as you want):

var newerMe = Object.assign({}, me, {
  hair: "brown",
  age: 26
});

newerMe; // {first: "Conrad", last: "Knapp", hair: "brown", age: 26}
